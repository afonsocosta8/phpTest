The developed solution uses a native XML parser to convert XML to an array.
This array is then iterated and convertion is applied tag by tag:
  If a tag belongs to an element containing other elements then the json object is "opened".
  If the tag belongs to an element without other elements then the json object is "opened" and "closed" consecutively.
The program is divided in the following functions:
  is_valid_xml($xml): checks if the xml is valid; returns a boolean on true or false;
  xml_to_json($xml): converts the xml to json as described above (this is the function with all the juice); returns the json string;
  unit_tests(): performs unit tests with different inputs and evaluates different level of possible errors; Prints the result to terminal;
